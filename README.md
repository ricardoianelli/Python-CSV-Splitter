After that, click on 'Select' and select the .csv file you want to split, then change the 'Rows per file' to the value of rows/lines each splitted file should have at maximum.
Then, just click on 'Split!' and the script will read your file, split it into multiple files respecting the rows limit you've defined and then save them in an output folder in the same folder of the origin .csv.
